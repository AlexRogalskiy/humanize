h1. Humanize for Java

Humanize is a Java facility for adding a "human touch" to data. It is thread-safe and supports per-thread internationalization. Additionally provides a concise facade for access to the "International Components for Unicode":http://icu-project.org/ (ICU) Java APIs.

h2. Getting Started

The project is not yet available in any public Maven repository, so you can "fork it on Github":https://github.com/mfornos/humanize/fork or download the jar package from the "project downloads":https://github.com/mfornos/humanize/downloads section.

h2. Runtime Dependencies

* icu4j 49.1

If you want to customize the data included in ICU by default (all features and languages ~7.1MB), you can use the "ICU Data Library Customizer":http://apps.icu-project.org/datacustom/

h2. Usage

Using Humanize is dead simple. See the javadoc "documentation":http://mfornos.github.com/humanize/apidocs/index.html?org/nikko/humanize/Humanize.html

# Import the static methods of the Humanize class that you want to call.
# Invoke these methods.

bc.. import static org.nikko.humanize.Humanize.binaryPrefix; 
 
 class SomeClass {
   void doSomething() {
     String size = binaryPrefix(1325899906842624L); // 1.18 PB
   }
 }
